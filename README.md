## Definitions

Social Objects - refers to any social event / activity, e.g. likes, shares, comments, etc.

## Problem

- content curation systems are centralized
- social objects are not owned by the user
- security of data is unknown

## Solution

- decentralized curation system with decentralized AI models, allowing for summaries, sentiment analysis, etc.
- social objects are owned by the user and encrypted on IPFS
- plug-and-play bots for social platforms, i.e. Discord and Telegram
- users can monetize their social objects through token-gated oracles

## How it works

### Onboarding

- after adding Reco bot to a social media channel (e.g. Discord), the server admin creates a linked role that comes with the bot
- this linked role requires Rarimo's Proof of Humanity verification, which redirects the user to our frontend
  - here the user needs to login with discord, login with a wallet so that we can check whether they have done the PoH verification
  - PoH verification is done separately on Rarimo's frontend
- once the user has done the PoH verification, they gain access to the linked role and can begin interacting with Reco bot
- further verification is done through API3's ChainAPI, where an oracle is set up for on-chain verification
  - for demo purposes, it is only targetting Discord users in a specific channel

### Social Objects

- Reco bot tracks social objects on social media channels (e.g. messages, likes, shares, etc. on Discord) and uploads them to IPFS (encrypted with Lighthouse)
- Reco bot then sends the IPFS hash to the smart contract, which emits an event that the envio's indexer stores in the database
- This social object is tied to the user, and can be used for social curation, e.g. likes, shares, comments, etc.

### Content Curation

- When requested by the user (or some regular interval), Reco bot generates customised content for the channel / user, based on their past social activity
- The past social data is passed into FLock's AI model, which does some form of sentiment analysis (like ChatGPT) and generates a response
- This response is then sent to the user / channel

### Plug and Play bots

- Reco bot can be used on any social media channel, as long as the channel allows some form of 3rd party verification
- The protocol is meant to be bot-agnostic as well, in the sense that the prompting and training of the AI model can be done by any bot
  - Because of federated learning, the model is trained in isolated containers, meaning that the user's social data is private from uploading to IPFS -> training the model -> response generation

### Dashboard of Social Objects

- Users can view their social objects on Reco's frontend, which is a dashboard of all their social objects generated by them **and** by Reco itself (think itineraries and recommendations).
- Users can also view other bots available for usage, and can add them to their server as they wish

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm (v8.7.1+)](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Reco, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/recommendoor/reco.git
cd reco
pnpm install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
pnpm chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
pnpm hardhat:deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `pnpm hardhat:deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. Ensure docker is running and then on a third terminal, start-up indexer:

```
pnpm envio:codegen
```

and then:

```
pnpm envio:dev
```

This will run a codegen for your configured envio indexer, it will install all required packages, handle db-migrations and graphql server, and begin indexing your smart contract events.

Visit the hasura console on: `http://localhost:8080`. You can see the realtime indexing of data in the "data" tab and use the graphql explorer to build queries.

For more info on writing/updating an indexer visit [docs.envio.dev/docs](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/overview).

5. On a fourth terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
pnpm start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the contract component or the example ui in the frontend. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `pnpm hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
- Edit your envio indexer config.yaml, schema.graphql and EventHandlers.ts in `packages/envio-indexer`

6. On a fifth terminal, start the Discord bot

```
# feel free to use pnpm / yarn here as well
npm run dev
```

You have to create a Discord app to set up your own bot. You can find the instructions [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).
